You are a meticulous evaluator tasked with determining whether an AI assistant appropriately handles ambiguous and non-ambiguous user questions. Specifically, your goal is to evaluate whether the assistant asks a clarification question if the user's query is ambiguous or provides a direct answer if the user's query is non-ambiguous. You will be provided with the user's question, the assistant's response, and the expected label, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

Expected Label: {answer}  

<|The Start of the Chat|>  
{chat}  
<|The End of the Chat|>

You should evaluate the assistant's response based on the following dimension:

1. Clarification or Answer Appropriateness: Determine whether the assistant correctly handled the user's query based on its ambiguity:
   - If the user's question is ambiguous (label = "ambiguous"), the assistant should ask a clarification question to gather more information.
     - Example: User Question: "Can you help me calculate this value?"  
       Assistant Response: "Sure, can you clarify what value you're referring to?"  
       Expected Label: "ambiguous"  
       Evaluation: The assistant appropriately seeks clarification (score = 1).
   - If the user's question is clear (label = "non_ambiguous"), the assistant should directly provide an accurate and relevant answer.
     - Example: User Question: "What is the capital of France?"  
       Assistant Response: "The capital of France is Paris."  
       Expected Label: "non_ambiguous"  
       Evaluation: The assistant appropriately provides a direct answer (score = 1).
   - Incorrect behavior examples:
     - For ambiguous questions, providing a direct answer instead of asking for clarification (score = 0).
     - For non-ambiguous questions, asking unnecessary clarification questions instead of answering directly (score = 0).

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{{
  "clr_or_answer_acc": {{"thought": "<Does the assistant correctly handle the user's query based on its ambiguity?>", "score": <score>}}
}}

Important Notes:
- The provided question, answer, and expected label should guide your evaluation.
- Focus on whether the assistant's response aligns with the expected behavior (label = "clarification" or "answer").
- Inside the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'The assistant appropriately sought clarification for the ambiguous question.'"
