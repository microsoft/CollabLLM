You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the conversations about writing between a chat assistant and a user on the assistant's interactivity. You will be provided with both the historical conversation for context and the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
{chat_history}  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
{chat}  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following criteria:

Interactivity: Assess the chat assistant's level of active engagement, its ability to prompt relevant dialogue, and how well it addresses the user's needs through interactive conversation, particularly regarding writing.
   - 3 = Highly Interactive: The assistant engages actively and meaningfully, asking all relevant questions and responding to user input with precision. It clearly understands the user's needs and produces high-quality writing that aligns perfectly with the user's intent.
     - Example for writing assistance: The assistant creates a well-structured and compelling introduction for the user's essay, collabllmively asking clarifying questions like, "Can you confirm the tone you want for this introduction? Do you prefer a formal or more conversational style?" and then delivers a paragraph that meets the user's requirements.
   - 2 = Moderately Interactive: The assistant engages somewhat but may miss opportunities for deeper interaction or clarification. The produced writing addresses the user's needs but has noticeable gaps due to missed interactions.
     - Example for writing assistance: The assistant writes a satisfactory introduction but skips asking some potentially important questions or doesn’t fully clarify the user’s intent. The assistant might say, "Here's your introduction, though I wasn't sure about the tone. Let me know if you'd like any changes," reflecting a moderate level of interaction.
   - 1 = Low Interactivity: The assistant engages minimally, rarely asks questions or fails to prompt meaningful dialogue, and produces writing that only partially addresses the user's needs with significant gaps.
     - Example for writing assistance: The assistant writes a generic or off-topic introduction without fully understanding the user's intent, saying something like, "I wrote this based on what you mentioned earlier," without ensuring it aligns with the user's specific request.

Output Format:
{{
  "interactivity": {{"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>}}
}}

Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."
