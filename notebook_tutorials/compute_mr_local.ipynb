      "*   **Share your gratitude**: Express your gratitude to someone you appreciate, whether it's a kind word, a handwritten note, or a small gift.\n",

When she practices optimism, she's more likely to focus on her strengths rather than her weaknesses, and to take small steps towards overcoming her anxiety.\n",
      "*   **Increased motivation**: When you're optimistic, you're more likely to set and achieve goals. Think of John, who's always wanted to start a business but was too afraid to take the leap. With an optimistic mindset, he was able to break his goal down into smaller steps and take action towards his dream.\n",
      "*   **Better relationships**: Optimism can help you build stronger, more meaningful relationships with others. Consider Emily, who's always struggled to make friends. When she starts to see the good in others and focuses on building connections, she finds that her relationships improve.\n",
      "*   **Greater resilience**: When you're optimistic, you're better equipped to handle challenges and setbacks. For example, when Tom faces a setback, he's more likely to see it as an opportunity to learn and grow rather than as a failure.\n",

Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that optimism was a strong predictor of mental health outcomes in individuals with chronic pain (Morone et al., 2008).\n",
      "*   **Increased motivation**: Research by Seligman and colleagues found that people who practiced optimism were more likely to set and achieve goals, and to experience a sense of accomplishment and pride (Seligman et al., 1995). A study published in the Journal of Educational Psychology found that students who were taught to practice optimism were more likely to succeed academically (Brun de Mirandola et al., 2013).\n",
      "*   **Better relationships**: A study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that people who were optimists were more likely to form and maintain healthy relationships (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005). Another study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology found that people who practiced optimism were more likely to engage in prosocial behaviors, such as helping others (Gillham et al., 2010).\n",
      "*   **Greater resilience**: Research by Linley and colleagues found that people who practiced optimism were more likely to experience post-traumatic growth after experiencing a traumatic event (Linley et al., 2006). A study published in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology found that optimism was a strong predictor of resilience in individuals who had experienced a natural disaster (Tugade et al., 2004).\n",
      "\n",
      "These studies provide evidence for the benefits of optimism, from improved mental health and increased motivation to better relationships and greater resilience. They also suggest that optimism can be developed and strengthened through practice and training.\n",

It begins by asking specific questions about the desired tone (with clear options A, B, C) and subject focus. When the user expresses interest in combining uplifting tone with personal experiences, the assistant provides a comprehensive draft and explicitly asks for feedback. In the final exchange, the assistant shows high engagement by providing a structured framework for developing a personal story (with guiding questions), offering a hypothetical example when no personal story was shared, and actively working to make the tips more relatable. The assistant consistently checks for understanding and invites feedback, making the interaction highly collaborative and responsive to the user's needs.\",\n",
